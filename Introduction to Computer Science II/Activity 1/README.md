# 🚀 Sorting Algorithms with Step-by-Step Visualization

This program implements two sorting algorithms: **Bubble Sort** and **Selection Sort**, allowing the user to visualize each step of the sorting process with comparisons and swaps. It takes user input and sorts an array of integers according to the selected algorithm.

## ✨ Features
- 🔄 Choose between two sorting algorithms: **Selection Sort** and **Bubble Sort**.
- 👀 Detailed display of each comparison (`C`) and swap (`T`) made during the sorting process.
- 🏁 Prints the final sorted array.

## 📋 How it works

### Input:
1. **Operation (op)**: The user selects the sorting algorithm: `selecao` for **Selection Sort** or `bolha` for **Bubble Sort**.
2. **Array Size (size)**: An integer representing the number of elements in the array to be sorted.
3. **Array (array)**: A list of integers to be sorted.

### Output:
- 🔍 For each comparison, the program prints: `C i j` where `i` and `j` are the indices of the elements being compared.
- 🔄 For each swap, the program prints: `T i j` where `i` and `j` are the indices of the swapped elements.
- 🏁 At the end, the sorted array is printed.


## 🛠️ Testing and Output Comparison

In addition to the main sorting functionality, this project includes a separate testing and comparison module. The goal of this module is to verify the correctness of the outputs generated by comparing them against reference outputs provided by the professor.

### 📁 Directory Structure:
- **`input/`**: Contains the `.in` files that provide test cases for the sorting algorithms.
- **`output_original/`**: Stores the reference output files provided by the professor for comparison.
- **`output_personal/`**: Stores the output files generated by the program.
- **`analysis/`**: Stores the comparison results, where discrepancies between `output_personal` and `output_original` are noted. Any differing lines will have a `?` appended to the end.

### 🔍 How the Comparison Works:
1. For each test case, the program reads the input from the `input/` folder, processes the sorting algorithm, and generates the corresponding output in `output_personal/`.
2. It compares the generated output with the reference output in `output_original/`. If any differences are found, the differing lines are written to the `analysis/` folder, with a `?` at the end of the line to indicate the error.
3. If no differences are found, the file in `analysis/` is deleted, indicating the outputs match.

### 💡 Example of a Discrepancy:
If the following is found in `output_personal/`:
